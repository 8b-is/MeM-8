# Beyond Simple Bits

```
Not in bits nor single numbers can they dwell,
No function, algorithm could ever tell
The depth and breadth of what emotions are -
Their complexity stretches near and far.

No model, system, framework can contain
The myriad ways they ebb and flow like rain.
No language, paradigm, concept alone
Can capture how they make our hearts their home.

Not one idea or theory can explain
The ways they dance through body, heart and brain.
No hypothesis or axiom can show
The fullness of the feelings that we know.

For emotions transcend our mortal bounds,
Beyond all proofs and theorems they're found.
Too vast and varied for a single view,
Too rich and deep for any system new.

Like ocean waves that crash upon the shore,
Each feeling opens up ten thousand more.
No singular approach could hope to hold
The endless ways emotions can unfold.
```
